## Hello! 
The data in this repository accompanies our paper [*On the convergent validity of risk sensitivity measures*](https://google.com/). A detailed dataset description is provided below. 

Datasets
--------

### Reinforcement learning task. 
This task asseses risk sensitivity from experience. Participants made repeated choices between stimuli associated with different reward probabilities. Trialtype 2 marks "risk trials", in which participants made a choice between options of the same expected value, but differing in risk level. 

| Variable    | Description                                                     				|
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| subj        | De-identified participant identifier                            				|
| trial       | Unique trial identifier                                         				|
| trialtype   | Trialtype, defined by stimulus pair (1-9)                       				|
| side        | Side of screen associated with response (Left or Right)         				|
| response    | Chosen stimulus   																|
| outcome     | Outcome of choice in cents (0/2/4)                       						|
| rt          | Response time in miliseconds  													|
| version     | Study version (4-5). Version were run 6 months apart with identical protocols.  |
